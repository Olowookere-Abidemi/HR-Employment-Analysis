## **Data Cleaning Overview**
The dataset underwent a comprehensive cleaning process to ensure accuracy, consistency, and usability in Power BI. Key steps included:

### 1. **Column Header Standardization**

- Replaced shorthand values (e.g., `m` and `f` in Gender) with full terms (`Male` and `Female`).
- Applied consistent formatting to categorical data such as Department and Recruitment Channel.

### 3. **Irrelevant Data Removal**
- Removed columns such as `Previous Year Rating` and `Education` that were deemed unnecessary for analysis.

### 4. **Formatting Adjustments**
- Applied proper case formatting to fields like `Region` (e.g., `region_26` was updated to `Region 26`).

**Impact**:  
This cleaning process resulted in a streamlined and reliable dataset that supported accurate KPI calculations, demographic breakdowns, and departmental comparisons.
